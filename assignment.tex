\section*{Introduction}
I am trying to make the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) game in assembly. I initially tried to make
a calculator in assembly but realise the time to implement such an application is too long. I 
decide to make RPS becasue I could make it realitively easy, where there are two inputs and 3 outputs
(including the screen). The users makes a selection either Rock, Paper or no button down for Scissors, 
then the computer will make a decision after 4 seconds and and display its answer.  An indicator LED 
will light up red or green depending if the player lost or won respectively.

\section*{Design Outline}
Physical components of the build was 2 10k ohm resistors, 2 1k Ohm resistors, 2 buttons,
2 LED's and a lot of wiring, the physical setup of the system is realitively easy due to the simplicity
of the hardware. The software components was written in FASM becasue that is what I have been taught.
The functions I have created are the 3 different actions Rock, Paper and Scissors

where they link up to a created function called DrawChars (located in DrawChar.asm) which will handle the drawing of the characters
on to the display.
\\
The program first waits for a user input and declares a response respectively, if the user selects scissors (e.g no input) the lights
do not turn on and declare a draw. When the user selects rock it will turn on the green LED and declare the user the winner, then if
the user selects Paper it will display a red LED indicating the user has lost.

\end{figure}

The other functions created are just inialising the GPIO pins and defining the inplementation of the screen so the users input can view
their choice visually.


\section*{Assumptions}
I have assumed that using the GPIO reference doc that was in the earlier labs was fair to use.

\section*{Unresolved Problems}
As of current build the Ai only ever chooses Scissors and therefore the user can always win.
